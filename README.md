## Usage with nginx reverse proxy

Websockets require some extra configuration when hosted behind an nginx proxy. Add these lines to the `location` block inside the nginx configuration for your site:

```conf
location / {
  # other lines...
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
}
```
